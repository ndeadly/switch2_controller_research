# Switch 2 Controller Research

Several people have asked if I was sharing my Switch 2 controller research publicly, so here you go. I will be updating this repository with new findings as I go.

I have also set up a [#switch2-research](https://discord.gg/gegfNZ5Ucz) channel on my Discord server to encourage collaboration between other prominent developers. Feel free to join and contribute, or just lurk and follow along.
